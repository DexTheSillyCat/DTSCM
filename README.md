# DTSCM (DexTheSillyCat's Multitools)
Hello hello! Right now you are seeing my first, best attempted multitools!

To see whats currently planned, go to the projects tab, and look for `Main Project`.

## Disclaimers
> [!WARNING]
> The multitools is in the planning stage. You wont be able to test it in the moment right now.
> However, if you want to suggest features, options, or anything, do one of the following:
> - Open an issue.
>    - The most easiest but hardest for me to do.
>    - Just type in the feature details and any other information, and bam! You are done.
> - Open a pull request.
>    - The most hardest but a bit easier for me to do.
>    - First off, fork this repository or make a branch.
>    - Implement what feature you wish.
>    - Make a pull request with a bit of info for me to review.
>    - If accepted, it will be merged!
>
> (You will be credited as a contributer, if accepted.)
> 
> Reminder, if there is plenty of requested features, then ill invididually choose which suites the best for the sake of the multitools.

> [!NOTE]
> Okay i forgot to mention, but this is just for funsies. Since i saw a few multitools, i gotten the motivation to make one.
>
> (Maybe in the way i can get serious of making this and make this project come true..)
