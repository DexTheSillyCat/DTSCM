# DTSCM (DexTheSillyCat's Multitools)
Hello hello! Right now you are seeing my first, best attempted multitools!

To see whats currently planned, go to the projects tab, and look for `Main Project`, or go to `Issues` and check issues with the label `accepted`.

(Psst. Hey! You have a chance right now to get your feature added to this!)

## Disclaimers
> [!WARNING]
> The multitools is in the planning stage. You wont be able to test it in the moment right now.
> However, if you want to suggest features, options, or anything, check the `Contributing` tab/file.
> 
> Reminder, if there is plenty of requested features, then ill invididually choose which suites the best for the sake of the multitools.

> [!NOTE]
> Okay i forgot to mention, but this is just for funsies. Since i saw a few multitools, i gotten the motivation to make one. (especially SMT)
>
> (Maybe in the way i can get serious of making this and make this project come true..)
