*Any form of contributing (issues, pull requests, etc.) is greatly appreciated!*

> [!TIP]
> Hey! If you came here from the readme (to suggest features, enhancements, etc.), then read more of how to contribute!
> Here are `2` ways to contribute:
> - Open an issue.
>    - The most easiest but hardest for me to do.
>    - Just type in the feature details and any other information, and bam! You are done.
> - Open a pull request.
>    - The most hardest but a bit easier for me to do.
>    - First off, fork this repository or make a branch.
>    - Implement what feature you wish.
>    - Make a pull request with a bit of info for me to review.
>    - If accepted, it will be merged!
> 
> ### However, if theres a bug you found and needs to be fixed, theres ONE option:
> - Open an issue.
>    - Very simple, just tell the bug and where is it triggering, and if possible, point out the code that is faulty.
> - Open a pull request.
> 
>       - ONLY do this option if you know what you are doing!
>    - Make a fork or a branch.
>    - Re-code the part where the bug happenes.
>    - Make an pull request.
>    - Wait until the code gets verified by me or someone else.
>    - Then it will be merged!
> Thats all!!
